Here are some basic regex symbols to use (often the opposite of something is expressed by using it's capital). This is basically a cheatsheet, in the next post I will show some real word applications of grep and regular expressions.

| Symbol | Use                           | Symbol | Use                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| .      | any character except new line |
| ^      | beginning of string           |
| \$     | end of string                 |
| \d     | any digit 0-9                 | \D     | anything not a digit |
| \w     | any word                      | \W     | anything not a word  |
| \s     | whitespace                    | \S     | not whitespace       |
| \b     | word boundary (starts word)   | \B     | not word boundary    |

<hr>

example = Ha HaHa

**\b**Ha matches : **Ha Ha**Ha  
**\b**Ha**\b** matches : **Ha** HaHa  
**\B**Ha matches : Ha Ha**Ha**

^Ha matches : **Ha** HaHa  
Ha\$ matches : Ha Ha**Ha**

### Character Set = []

phone number 123-456-7890 or 123.456.7890  
\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d

on 800 or 900 numbers
[89]00[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d

match between  
[0-9] matches numbers 0-9  
[a-zA-Z] matches all letters  
in character sets a ^ matches everything not in the string  
example [^b]at : **cat mat** bat **sat**

### Quantifiers

\* = 0 or more  
\+ = 1 or more
? = 0 or 1  
{3} = exact number
{3,4} = range of numbers

example for phone numbers
\d{3}[-.]\d{3}[-.]\d{4}

Mr\.?\s[A-Z]\w*
M(r|s|rs)\.?\s[A-Z]\w*

### Emails Example:

[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z-]+\.(com|edu|net|io)  
[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9.]+

### URL Example

https?://(www\.)?\w+\.\w+

#### To Group

```bash
# Group:     1    2     3
https?://(www\.)?(\w+)(\.\w+)
```

In replace $2$3 (or \2\3) will return group 2 and 3

### Overlapping Patterns

search for patterns of zeros surrounded by ones:  
(10+1)  
11110001001111 : match 1 = 10001

(?=(10+1))  
11110001001111 : match 1 = 10001 match 2 = 1001

Search Before (?<=pattern)
